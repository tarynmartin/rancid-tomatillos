# Rancid Tomatillos Project
## Mod 3 Front End Paired Project

### Abstract
We created an app that allows users to rate movies, check out movie information, and add comments to movies when they are logged in. We used React JS, HTML, CSS, and Jest for testing.

### App in Action

### Setup
1) Click the green code button on the screen and clone/copy the repository link
2) In terminal, navigate to where you would like this project to live.
3) In terminal, type `git clone [copied link from Github]`
4) Move into the project file and run `npm install` and then `npm install prop-types`
5) In packages.json, make sure that dependencies include react-router-dom. If you need to install it, in terminal enter 'npm install --save react-router-dom'
6) Once all dependencies are downloaded, in terminal run 'npm start' - this should open a new window in your browser, allowing you to navigate throughout the site.
7) If you would like to check out the commenting functionality, go to this [repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/rancid-tomatillos-microservice) and follow the directions to run this local server on your computer.
8) If you would like to run the testing functionality, go to the main project directory in terminal and run the following commands if needed:
  - 'npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react'
  - 'npm install --save-dev @testing-library/jest-dom'
  - 'npm install --save-dev jest-environment-jsdom-sixteen'
9) Once everything is downloaded, run npm test in terminal to see test results.

### Successes
- Finished iterations 0 - 7a
- Learned a lot about React, Router, and accessing information through API's and local servers.

### Challenges
- We struggled with communication and workflow throughout the project, definitely something we would like to work on in the future
- Testing was difficult to wrap our brains around and would like more practice in the future.

### Next Steps
- Flesh out testing suites
- Complete iteration 7b
- Refactor code to be cleaner - is there anything that can be moved from App to a different Component
- Switch from CSS to SCSS
- Create a link for the page title to take the user back to the homepage
